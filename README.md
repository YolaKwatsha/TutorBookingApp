Display tutor locations to assist students in finding nearby tutors - Students can search for tutors within a certain radius of their current location, making it easier to locate and connect with tutors who are geographically convenient. Support booking requests and confirmations between students and tutors – Students and tutors have options to work around their schedules. Implement a review system to gather feedback from students about tutor sessions – Students can leave reviews about their sessions. Enhance communication between students and tutors via in-app messaging. Notify both tutors and students about booking requests, and confirmations.
